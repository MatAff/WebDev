<h4>Typing Tyrant</h4>
Recently, I wrote a little program to keep track of my typing skills and I wanted to share a quick code walk through. The idea behind the program is simple: stimulate myself to type a little bit more accurately and efficiently. I wanted this to run no matter what I'm working, so I set it up as a console application that checks keys pressed in any application. To determine typing accuracy I keep track of how often the backspace key is pressed in comparison to other keys.  
<br><br>
I've have gone through different versions of this program, from ones that beeps every time the backspace keys is pressed to versions that keep track of accuracy overtime and only beep when accuracy falls below a certain threshold. I have used some version of the program over the past couple months and I can definitely see progress. Because I'm constantly getting feedback on how accurately I'm typing, either from the program directly or because the people around ask me to type more accurately so they don't have to listen to my beeping.I've added the code to my github account and you can find it at <a href="https://github.com/MatAff/TypingTyrant">https://github.com/MatAff/TypingTyrant</a>. It's a relatively simple program written in c++ and all the code is stored in a single file. 
The first step is checking if a key is pressed using a for loop and the GetAsyncKeyState() function. 
<pre>
for (i = 8; i <= 190; i++) { <br>
    if (GetAsyncKeyState(i) == -32767) { … } <br>
}
</pre>
Next we check if the key that's being pressed is the backspace key. Using the following code where 8 is the ASCII value associate with the backspace key. If the key pressed is not the backspace we simply increment the counter that keeps track of the number of keys pressed since the last time the backspace key was pressed. 
<pre>
if (i == 8) { … }
</pre>
I'm counting multiple backspaces presses as one mistake, as you may have typed several characters before you realized you made mistake a few characters back, leading to multiple backspace presses at once. I'm doing this by calculating the difference between the current time and the last time the backspace key was pressed. If they are less then a certain threshold apart I ignore the current backspace press (currently I have the threshold value set to one second).
<pre>  
long timeDiff = getTime() - lastTime;
if (timeDiff > 1000) { … // Time is in milliseconds
</pre>
If the backspace press does not follow a recent press we can process the press. 
This involved checking how many keys were pressed since the last backspace and updating the running averages. In the latest version (at the time of this writing), I'm keeping track of two average, a long term and a short term average. 
<pre>
longRunningAvg = longRunningAvg * 0.75 + nrChar * 0.25;
shortRunningAvg = shortRunningAvg * 0.5 + nrChar * 0.5;
</pre>
By keeping track of two average I can use one as a goal and the other as current performance. In the current version the goal is to keep the short term average above the long term average. This might be a pretty challenging target, as it would imply the user would need to constantly improve their typing skills. I may make this more lenient in the future, but what trying to achieve was an adaptive learning approach where the goal is constantly adjusted depending on the users performance, by making the goal both challenging and obtainable, giving the user constant motivation to improve. 

So what happens if the goal is not met? This is where the peeps come in, if the short-term average falls below the long-term average the program starts beeping every time backspace key is pressed. This gives the user an immediate reminder to focus on their typing accuracy. 
<pre>
if (shortRunningAvg < longRunningAvg) {
    Beep(1000, 100);
}
</pre>
And there you have it, a simple program that serves as your own personal Typing Tyrant, that watches over you every key press. If you like the set up, feel free to grab a copy from GitHub, compile it and test it out for yourself! Let me know if you make any improvements I'd be excited to try them out!

Happy typing!
