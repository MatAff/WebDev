<h4>First Post!</h4>
Here we go, my first ever blog post. Honestly, I never thought I'd be writing one of these, but after giving it some thought, I decided to give it a go, for a couple of reasons: Firstly, I figured writing blog posts would be a good way to document the projects I work on. Secondly, it will require me to be more systematic in how I approach the challenges and problems I run into. Finally I see it as a good way to share knowledge, which of course is a two way process, so I look forward to your comments and suggestions!

A word of warning, don't expect this blog to be about just one topic. It will most likely be a collection of posts about anything that sparks my interest! There will probably be a number of posts related to: data analysis, machine learning, programming, and robotics. If there's code involved, I will often point to my GitHub account. I will avoid rehashing information that is described well elsewhere, though I could post about articles/books I've read, if I think are mentioning!

Happy reading!
