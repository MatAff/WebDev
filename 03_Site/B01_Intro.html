<h3>First Post!</h3>

Here we go, my first ever blog post. Honestly, I never thought I'd be writing one of these, but after giving it some thought, I decided to give it a go for a couple of reasons: Firstly, I figured writing blog post would be a good way to document the little projects I'm working on. Secondly, it will require me to be more systematic in how I approach challenges and problems I run into. Finally I see it as a good way to share knowledge, which of course is a two way process, so I look forward to your comments and suggestions!

A word of warning don't expect this blog to be about just one topic. It will most likely be a collection of posts about anything that sparks my interest! Though there will likely be a number of posts related to: data analysis, machine learning, programming, robotics. If there's code involved I will often point to my GitHub account. I will avoid rehashing information that is described well elsewhere, could post about articles/books I've read, if I think are really worth exploring!

Happy reading!
