<h4>Learning Java and Taking an Exam</h4>
DRAFT!!!
I'd been meaning to take a deep dive into Java for about 5 yearsâ€¦ yes for a long time and I never really got to it. This time I did it. I'll tell you how. Previously I dabbled with java by following tutorials on YouTube or by creating basic Android apps, but it never really stuck. This time round I set myself a more serious goal and that was to pass the Oracle Certified Associate Programmer I exam. I would imagine that most people that take the exam already know a lot about Java but having the goal of passing the exam really help me to dive into the details and in the process I learned a lot!
<br><br>
There are two ways to take the exam, you can take a paid course or you can do through self study and just pay for the exam, which is $250.-. Honestly, passing the exam turned about to be a lot harder than I expected, which I realized after working through the first book I got and doing the practice exam at the end... I bought another book, and then another...
<br><br>
I ended up using three different books which I've outlined below. 
Jeanne Boyarsky & Scott Selikoff -  OCA: Oracle Certified Associate Java SE 8 Programmer I Study Guide: Exam 1Z0-808
Mala Gupta - OCA Java SE 8 Programmer I Certification Guide
Silviu Sosiade - Oracle Certified Associate Java SE 8 Programmer - Practice Questions 
<br><br>
I would recommend especially recommend the first two books, but particularly the one by Mala Gupta, as it explains everything very clearly (though that might have been my experience as I read it second). The book by Boyarsky & Selikoff is nice, as there is a book available for the follow-up exam (OCP), there is no book by Gupta for the OCP. The third book was a book that only contains practice questions and honestly it was of pretty poor quality they were lots of typos,  practice questions with incorrect answers, and so on. Despite the quality I do feel I got something out of it even if it was because I have to research topics you more detail to be sure that the answer that was stated as correct was actually wrong.
<br><br>
In addition to reading the books in great detail, and doing the practise question, I also wrote a tonne of simple practice programs. This sounds like a lot of work, but it's often the best way to learn. And writing them becomes easier as you write more of them.

On my GitHub page you will find a repository Revol sample programs I wrote don't expect an organized list these programs are really one-offs and her purely  for explorative reasons but you might find some use for it.
To write these I found the Raspberry Pi extremely useful Raspberry Pi comes with Java pre-installed and it comes with the IDE blue jay. Blue jay is a very simple IDE and it really helps write simple programs. Because the Raspberry Pi has everything installed you're ready to go immediately 
After months of working towards the exam I finally felt ready and passed with a 91 out of 100 yes! But most importantly a much better understanding of java. And as it turns out many of the concepts translate well to other languages, such as c++ and even VBA. So by learning java you're actually developing a much wider understanding of code as a whole. 
<br><br>
So what's next? This was the level I exam, and I'll probably take the level II as well. After that the Oracle certifications become very specific. They seem very interesting and focus on for example Android development and javaFX, but even though I'll dive into those topics at some point, I probably won't take those exams just yet. 
You can find out more about the certifcation exam on the Oracle wesite.

Happy coding!
