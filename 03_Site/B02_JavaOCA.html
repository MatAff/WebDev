<h4>Learning Java and Taking the OCA Exam</h4>
I'd been meaning to take a deep dive into Java for a long time, but I never really got to it. This time I did it, I'll tell you how. Previously I dabbled with java by following tutorials on YouTube or by creating basic Android apps, but it never really stuck. This time round I set myself a more serious goal, and that was to pass the Oracle Certified Associate Programmer I exam. I would imagine that most people that take that exam already know a lot about Java but having the goal of passing the exam really help me to dive into the details and learn a lot in the process.
<br><br>
There are two ways to take the exam, you can take a paid course or you can do it through self study and just take the exam, which is $250.-. I went for the second option. Honestly, passing the exam turned out to be a lot harder than I expected, which I realized after working through the first book and doing the practice exam at the end... I bought another book, and then another...
<br><br>
I ended up using three different books which I've outlined below. 
<ul>
<li>Jeanne Boyarsky & Scott Selikoff -  OCA: Oracle Certified Associate Java SE 8 Programmer I Study Guide: Exam 1Z0-808
<li>Mala Gupta - OCA Java SE 8 Programmer I Certification Guide
<li>Silviu Sosiade - Oracle Certified Associate Java SE 8 Programmer - Practice Questions 
</ul>
I would recommend recommend the first two books, but particularly the one by Mala Gupta, as I felt it explains everything very clearly (though that might have been because I read it second). The book by Boyarsky & Selikoff is good if you want to do the follow-up exam (OCP) as well, as there is a second book available in the series. There is no book by Gupta for the OCP. The third book only contains practice questions and honestly, it was of pretty poor quality, they were lots of typos, practice questions with incorrect answers, and so on. Despite the quality I do feel I got something out of it, even if it was because I have to research topics in more detail to be sure that the answer that was stated as correct was actually wrong.
<br><br>
In addition to reading the books in great detail, and doing the practise question, I also wrote a tonne of simple practice programs. This sounds like a lot of work, but it's often the best way to learn. And writing them becomes easier as you write more of them. You can find the ones I wrote on my GitHub page: <a href="https://github.com/MatAff/Java_OCA_Exam">https://github.com/MatAff/Java_OCA_Exam</a> Don't expect an organized list, these programs are really one-offs and were purely  for explorative reasons but you might find some use for it. To write these I found the Raspberry Pi extremely useful as it comes with Java and the BlueJ IDE pre-installed so you are ready to go! <a href="https://www.bluej.org/">BlueJ</a> is a very basic IDE developed by the University of Kent and it really helps write simple programs, because you don't have to worry about the bells and whistles that IDE's typically come with. It took me several months to get ready for the exam until I finally felt ready and I passed with a score of 91 out of 100. So yes!!! I was great to pass, but most importantly I feel like I learned so much! And as it turns out many of the concepts translate well to other languages, such as c++ and even VBA. So by learning java you're actually developing a much wider understanding of coding as a whole. 
<br><br>
So what's next? This was the level I exam, and I'll probably take the level II as well. After that the Oracle certifications become very specific. They seem very interesting and focus on for example Android development and javaFX, but even though I'll dive into those topics at some point, I probably won't take those exams just yet. You can find out more about the Oracle certification exams on their <a href="https://education.oracle.com/pls/web_prod-plq-dad/db_pages.getpage?page_id=5001&get_params=p_exam_id:1Z0-808">website</a>. 
<br><br>
Happy coding!
